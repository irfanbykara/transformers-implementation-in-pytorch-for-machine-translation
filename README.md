# Reimplementation of Attention is All You Need in Pytorch
Pytorch reimplementation of Attention is All You Need paper for machine translation. https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762

# Training Results 
Trained the model for about 50 epochs with the default parameters on english to german dataset.
a cat sits next to the garden is translated into Eine Katze sitzt neben einem Garten, which is correct. 
One should keep in mind that dataset is not versatile in many aspects so it can not be used as a real translator model dataset. 
Use it only for educational purposes.
